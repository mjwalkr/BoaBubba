This is a list of changes that are pending to be included.

1.
Need to re-implement the Actor.isSnapped method. Currently, the method checks the position and the 'grid' location
of the Actor. This is problematic because there are instances where the Player can reverse direction when not even snapped
to the grid which will cause errors when deciding whether the instance is snapped or not.

Also because the position is denoted as a 'float', there can be rounding inconsistencies when deciding if the Actor
is actually 'snapped' to the grid.


Solution:
The Actor should only be snapped when it has reached its grid destination, denoted as 'grid' (not to be confused with previous grid and current grid,
the former denoting the previous grid location the Actor came from, while the latter denotes the Actor's 'current' grid that it is on).

When the Actor leaves the snapped position (when the Actor's position changes, from moving in a direction) then the Actor is no longer snapped.


Concerns:
1. Where all in the code does the Actor check whether it is snapped or not?
2. Where should the Actor change the snapped property?
